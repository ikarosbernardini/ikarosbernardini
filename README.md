## Hey there, Ikaros here :)

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

A little bit about me:

I'm currently studying to become a full-time DevOps engineer at Nackademin in Solna, Sweden.

I have a strong passion for learning new things and finding smart ways to simplify work — whether it's small daily tasks or bigger technical challenges.

I'm currently learning Python in school, and I really enjoy working with it. I've also explored a bit of C# before, but my main interest lies in understanding systems — trying out different Linux distros and learning tools like Podman, Docker, AWS, Azure, and Kubernetes.

In my free time, I enjoy socializing with friends and following my football team — whether it's watching on TV, going to home games, or traveling to away matches.

Interesting fact: I'm originally from Malmö, Sweden — but I made a bold move to Barcelona, Spain, where I lived for three years. These days I'm based in Stockholm, and I’m not planning on moving anytime soon!
